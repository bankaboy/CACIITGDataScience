Compare different categories of explanatory variable with quantitative response using boxplots.

Compare different categories of explanatory variable with categorical response using two way tables and bar charts.

For quantitative explanatory variable with quantitative response variable, use scatterplot to see correlation.

Calculation: r is calculated using the following formula: 
r = (1/n-1)*âˆ‘[i to n] { ((xi-x')/Sx) * ((yi-y')/Sy) }

Y = a + b*X
b = r*(Sy/Sx)
a = Y'-b*X'


Principle
Association does not imply causation!

Here, the seriousness of the fire is a lurking variable. A lurking variable is a variable that is not among the explanatory or response variables in a study, but could substantially affect your interpretation of the relationship among those variables.
Whenever including a lurking variable causes us to rethink the direction of an association, this is an instance of Simpson's paradox.
